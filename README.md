# Security Login Form
This is an example of a secure login developed as part of a Web Security Project with the purpose of having a sealed login form.

## How To Run:
To try it out, the files need to be served by a web server (Apache) where you will need to implement the SQL dump included in the project. You will also have to generate a hashed password with the file *generate-password.php* and insert a user (with the password) directly into the database.
